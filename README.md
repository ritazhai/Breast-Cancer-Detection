# Breast-Cancer-Detection
Question: You belong to the data team at a local research hospital. You've been tasked with developing a means to help doctors diagnose breast cancer. You've been given data about biopsied breast cells; where it is benign (not harmful) or malignant (cancerous).
1.	What features of a cell are the largest drivers of malignancy?
2.	How would a physician use your product?
3.	There is a non-zero cost in time and money to collect each feature about a given cell. How would you go about determining the most cost-effective method of detecting malignancy?

The uploaded data file is processed for increasing the complexity of the data cleaning. You can directly use the original data(link below). This project is a very basic data science project. Good for the starter to play with. Suggestion: do some other data cleaning work; try logistic regression; fine-tune the model....

The description of the data is here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Original) and the dataset is available here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancer-wisconsin.data

The dataset contains the following features for each cell:
Sample code number: id number
Clump Thickness: 1 - 10
Uniformity of Cell Size: 1 - 10
Uniformity of Cell Shape: 1 - 10
Marginal Adhesion: 1 - 10
Single Epithelial Cell Size: 1 - 10
Bare Nuclei: 1 - 10
Bland Chromatin: 1 - 10
Normal Nucleoli: 1 - 10
Mitoses: 1 - 10
Class: (2 for benign, 4 for malignant)
